# employee-portfolio

## Description:

I built this project as a starting point for a personal web development profile for myself.  This will ideally be something that I can constantly update and provide to potential employers to showcase my development and styling skills along with some other projects that I have worked on.  It will also give them easy access to my resume, along with my LinkedIn & Github profiles and contact information.  This was the first project that I have worked on where I did not have starter code to base my project on.  It forced me to fill in the cracks of where my knowlege may have been lacking to put together a comprehensive, fully responsive web page.  It was challenging and satisfying to see this blossom in front of me after starting from nothing more than a blank file.
